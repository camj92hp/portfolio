# Cam's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm Cam a neuroscientist transitioning into the field of data science. My mission is to apply my technical coding skills and data science expertise to develop AI models that can accelerate scientific discoveries in healthcare.

- **Technical Expertise**: Python,  R,  SQL,  Excel and Tableau 
## Education 

- **Master of Science in Neuroscience**: Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC, 2020
- **Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry | Minor in Mathematics**: McGill University, Montréal, QC, 2018

## Professional Experience

### Université de Montréal
**Research Advisor | Montréal, QC | Sept 2020–Present**
- Strategically planned and executed wet-lab protocols, contributing to 25% of monthly data generation.
- Designed data analysis pipelines using Excel Python and in-house software to standardize data collection. 

### CRCHUM
**Graduate Student Research Assistant | Montréal, QC | Sept 2018–Aug 2020**
- Conducted thorough scientific literature searches, leading to 2 experimental protocols and scientific paper submissions.
- Performed molecular scientific research using various methods, including ELISA, PCRs, Flow cytometry, and antigen presentation assays.
- Efficiently managed experimental procedures and collaborations between two affiliated labs.

## Certification

- **Professional Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning**: Ongoing at McGill University.
  - Skills: Developing data pipelines, statistical analysis, implementing machine learning algorithms, testing and optimizing data & ML pipelines.
  
## Projects
- **McGill Courses Data Scraper**
- In this project, I developed a web scraper using Beautiful Soup to collect comprehensive information about the various degrees and courses offered at McGill University. This scraper is structured into three crucial steps: "soup_maker" for creating Beautiful Soup objects, "url_page_collector" to gather relevant URLs, and "extract_course" for retrieving detailed course information. The final step, "extract_all," utilizes Beautiful Soup to systematically extract and organize the required course details into a well-structured dictionary. This project lays the groundwork for future iterations and enhancements in web scraping and data collection for McGill University's academic offerings.
- **Sunspot Time Forecasting model**
- In this project, I leveraged Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast time series data, including sunspot activity and temperature records. After preprocessing the data, I trained three RNN models: Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU. The LSTM model outperformed the others, showcasing its aptitude for capturing complex temporal dependencies. This project demonstrates the power of RNNs in time series forecasting and highlights LSTM's efficacy for such tasks.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any of the projects listed in my portfolio. I'm always excited to connect with fellow professionals and enthusiasts in the fields of data science, AI, and healthcare.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
